inputs: puts print_me
outputs: "I'm printing the return value!"

*Questions*
1. Will #puts be used inside or outside the method? In this case, outside.

*Mental Model*
Create a method called print_me that will display the string "I'm printing the return value!" when puts print_me is used.

*Data Structure*
Define a method by using the word def and the method name. Print the string inside the method and use end to complete. Call method using puts.

*Algorithm*
1. def print_me
2. "I'm printing the return value!"
3. end
4. puts print_me
=end


def print_me
  "I'm printing the return value!"
end

puts print_me
