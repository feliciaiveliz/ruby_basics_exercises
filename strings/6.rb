*Required*
Capitalize the value of state then print the modified value. Note that state should have modified value both before and after you print it

*Algorithm*
1. state = 'tExAs'
2. Call capitalize! method on state to mutate caller
3. state.capitalize!
4. print before and after values

=end

state = 'tExAs'
state.capitalize!
puts state
